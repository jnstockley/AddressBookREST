# AddressBookREST
I have posted a minor update with some bug fixes and have made some improvements to help with my address book ui program that is upcoming. I will hopefully start making this program a whole lot better this summer when I am done with school. 

Features I plan to add:
1. Check for duplicate entries
2. Rewrite back end to fix bugs
3. Allow for easier changing of server specifics.
4. Encryption

I will update the readme when I finish the big update coming this summer! Hopefully.

Any other questions tweet me on twitter @jackstockley_ and Ill add it here
